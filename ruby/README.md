# Introduction
Your one-stop-shop for Instructure official Docker/Ruby love. If you
need ruby (2.1, 2.2, or 2.3) in Docker but don't need web services (we've
got `instructure/ruby-passenger` for that) you're in the right place.
Batteries (finicky C libs, see Dockerfile for full listing) are
included, so drop your app in (we suggest /usr/src/app) and start hacking.
